# TODO task app

Hey there, hope you had a great vacation. I took some liberty and upgraded your application a bit ;)

1. Upgraded React and other libraries to latest versions to access latest features.
2. Refactored you initial app to be functions based - it allows the access of hooks.
3. Added fully featured Node.js express server with routing to get, post and patch tasks.
4. Connected Firestore for data persistence.
5. Basically kept the same data structure. Except for task ID decided to use Firestore autogenerated document ID, hope you won't mind ;)
6. Didn't use any of state management libraries, because, well, there's no need for one.
7. Didn't use Typescript as there would be, possibly, only one type - Task 
  ```typescript
    type Task = {
      id: string,
      title: string,
      done: boolean,
    }
  ```
  
What could you improve next:
1. Create validators for express server endpoints.
2. Rewrite everything in TypeScript.


My own comments:
1. Didn't use TS as I have only basics of it, never worked in production with TS, but I am eager to learn.
2. Haven't worked with React at all since possibly when I started to learn to code some 2 years ago. Thus, I may lack some good practices.
3. I'm quite happy with server part - as I work with express day to day.
4. Google should work on their documentation.
